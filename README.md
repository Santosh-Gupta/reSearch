# reSearch
Takes search engine results and re ranks them. A work in progress. 

You need to alter the locations.py file (in /src/joins/locations.py). 

You need put a path to Java (you need Java 8 or above). 

You also need to link a location to the stanford parser, located at 
http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-parser-full-2015-04-20.zip
or you can go to their downloads page at http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download

You also need to link the location to a file named englishPCFG. The englishPCFG.ser.gz file can be 
found inside the models.jar file (/edu/stanford/nlp/models/lexparser/englishPCFG.ser.gz). 
Please use an archive manager to 'unzip' the models.jar file.
